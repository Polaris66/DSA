Q1 - Find Median
Soln. Find Total no of nodes. Put a for loop for median.

Q2 - Merge Sorted ll
Soln. Recursive Solution
	Base Case - if a is NULL, return b, if b is null, return a
	General Case - Make a merged ll, which is a/b, and merged->next = recursion
	Also has traversal soln.
	
Q3 - Sort ll
Soln. Merge Sort
	Divide lls, sort sub lls, merge sorted
	Divide - take n/2, make pointer for both

Q4 - Reverse ll
Soln. Take 3 pointers prev, curr, next
	Keep swapping prev and curr and traverse
	Also has recursive soln.

Q5 - Palindrome
Soln. Just traverse the ll for each value and check
	Or reverse the second half of the ll and check.
	
Q8 - Delete no
	Just traverse upto it and skip it.
	
Q9 - Make struct, divide id and do by hand


## Notes
* fgets() ends at newline and includes a '\n' for newline 
* strlen() does not count '\0'
* Make char array once and use pointers later.
